  <p>Approdictio provides dictionary implementations with approximate
  lookup. Such dictionaries can be used for spelling
  correction. A dictionary <em>D</em> is a set of
  terms <em>t</em>. Given a word <em>w</em>, the
  approximate lookup allows to find those terms <em>t</em> in <em>D</em>,
  which are most similar to <em>w</em>. The meaning of
  <em>similar</em> depends on the implementation used for the {@link
  approdictio.dict.IntMetric}.</p>

    <p>A combination of distance measure and frequency weighting is provided
    by the combination of {@link approdictio.dict.BKTree} and
    {@link approdictio.dict.BKStableLookup}. 
    It requires that words are added to the {@code BKTree} strictly in the
    order of descending weight. If this is not feasible, 
    {@link approdictio.dict.Didyoumean} provides an alternative but less
    elegant implementation.</p>

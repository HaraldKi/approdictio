  AppDict provides dictionary implementations with approximate
  lookup. These kinds of dictionaries can be used for spelling
  correction. Here, a dictionary <em>D</em> is nothing but a set of
  terms <em>t</em>. Given a word <em>w</em>, the dictionary
  implementation allows to find those terms <em>t</em> in <em>D</em>,
  which are most similar to <em>w</em>. The meaning of
  <em>similar</em> depends on the implementation.

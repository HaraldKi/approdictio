This software, called approdictio, is covered in all parts by the

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

as available in the file lgpl-2.1.txt with one exception:

Only this version of the license shall apply until further notice.


=== My Understanding of the LGPL ===

As long as you use the compiled jar in your projects or products, you
can do what you want with it. If you download or fetch the source
code and change it and provide the resulting project or product to
someone else, the LGPL obliges you to provide the amended source code
of approdictio as well. Alternatively you may convince me to add your
changes to the original.
